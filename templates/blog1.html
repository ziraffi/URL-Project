    <h1>Decoding the Secret Language of the Web</h1>
  </div>
    <p  style="font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 350;">Have you ever ordered something online, only to be met with a mysterious error message? Or perhaps you've clicked a link that stubbornly refuses to load? It's enough to make you want to throw your computer out the window! But fear not, curious internet citizen, for there's a hidden language at work behind the scenes, a language of codes that can unlock the secrets of your online woes.</p>

      <h2>Imagine the internet as a giant restaurant.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: large;">You (the customer) politely ask the waiter (the web server) for a specific dish (the webpage). The waiter scurries off to the kitchen (the server's database) to see if they have it. They then come back and give you a little note (the status code) explaining the situation.</p>

      <div class="text-center">
      <q style="font-size: 1.2rem; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">Here's where things get interesting! Let's meet some of the key characters in this digital drama</q>
    </div><br />
    <div class="inner-element">
        <h4>The Happy Diner (Status Code 200)</h4>
        <p style="font-size: large;">This is the golden ticket! A 200 code means "OK," just like the waiter happily presenting your delicious meal. Your request was successful, and the webpage is ready and waiting for you to devour (metaphorically speaking, of course).</p>
      </div>
    </div><br />
    
    <div class="content">
      <div class="inner-element">
        <h4>The Temporary Kitchen Hiccup (Status Code 301)</h4>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Sometimes, the kitchen might be rearranging things. A 301 code signifies a "Moved Permanently" situation. The waiter explains that your dish is now available at a new table (a different URL). Don't worry, they'll politely redirect you there.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br />
    
    <div class="content">
      <div class="inner-element">
        <h4>The Missing Ingredient (Status Code 404)</h4>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Uh oh! A 404 code screams "Not Found!" Just like the waiter searching high and low for that missing avocado for your toast, the server couldn't locate the webpage you requested. This could be because of a typo in the URL or the page simply being unavailable.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The most famous 404 error page belongs to a website called <span id="call-Text"><a href="https://xkcd.com/">https://xkcd.com/</a></span>. Their witty and ever-changing 404 messages have become a cult classic amongst web developers!</p>
      </div>
    </div><br />
    
    <div class="content">
      <div class="inner-element">
        <h4>The Hangry Customer (Status Code 500)</h4>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Things have gone terribly wrong in the kitchen! A 500 code indicates an "Internal Server Error." Imagine the waiter tripping and spilling all your food â€“ a technical malfunction on the server's end prevents your request from being fulfilled.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br />
